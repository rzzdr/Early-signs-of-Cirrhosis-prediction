# Early signs of Cirrhosis prediction
As hinted in this post [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e26/discussion/461062] XGB works well in classification, and that was the base idea.
The key was using a stacking approach with OOF from many other different top solutions and use XGB as meta model for training the stacked predictions + orginal features. And also try not to tune and optimize every solution to much, reduce the risk of overfitting, instead use the predictions as extra features in the final stacking training.

Many solutions shared the same small added feature engineering as below, rest was unchanged in terms of FE.

train_df['Age_Group'] = pd.cut(train_df['Age'], bins=[9000, 15000, 20000, 25000, 30000], labels=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'],)
train_df['Log_Age'] = np.log1p(train_df['Age'])
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
train_df['Scaled_Age'] = scaler.fit_transform(train_df['Age'].values.reshape(-1, 1))

## The different solutions and frameworks trained

### AutoGluon

AutoGluon latest pre-release 1.0.1b20231208 with zero-shot HPO as default. The trained framework used below weighted ensemble of models. I also tried distillation and pseudo labeling but didn’t work better.

### LightAutoML

Trained the LightAutoML 0.3.8b1 version and the trained frameworked used below weighted model ensemble.

Final prediction for new objects (level 0) =

[16:19:15] ==================================================

[16:19:15] Blending: optimization starts with equal weights and score -0.4164338072355177

### AutoXGB

Trained AutoXGB 5 fold CV with standard settings but with the extra features.

### Other trained solutions

Trained several other SOTA solutions and ideas, like using old top solutions from old competitions multiclass and binary as well, train every class separately and use the predictions as extra features. It worked well but the four solutions below was enough looking in the mirror.

### Stacking

I then trained the final 20 fold XGB model as meta model with the original features, the extra created and OOF predictions, the CV score went better. I also trained a 2 level stacking approach with several of tested stacked XGB models, as an approach instead of ensemble for the second submission.
